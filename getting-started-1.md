# Getting Started

To begin using the Grief Prevention GUI Addon:

1. **Installation**: Place the plugin JAR file into your server's `plugins` directory.​
2. **Configuration**: Upon first run, the plugin will generate default configuration files. Customise these files (`config.yml`, `flagSettings.yml`, etc.) to suit your server's needs.​
3. **GUI Access**: Players can access the GUI using the `/claim` command.​
4. **Permissions**: Ensure appropriate permissions are set up for different user roles to control access to various features. &#x20;
